For Webserver i need to work with cliend and server.

For server:
    Create a socket
    Bind the socker
    Listen on the socker
    Accept a connnction
    Send and receive data
    Disconnect

For client:
    Create a socker
    Connect to server
    Send and receive data
    Disconnect

To compile:
 g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp ./Socket/ListeningSocket.cpp ./Socket/BindingSocket.cpp ./Socket/SimpleSocket.cpp ./Socket/ConnectingSocket.cpp -o test -ISocket

Current state:
I simplified the test. Currently i create client and server in 1 file test.cpp on different threads and just see if they connect.
Next step would be to create a Server class and maybe Client? (not sure yet). 
For the server class i want to have an array of pointers to Socket classes and member function that creates it.
I am still not sure if it makes sense to change Listening class to Listening and Accepting?
